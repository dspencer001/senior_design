eye jpgs --- Used to quickly test the functionality of our code

./src/python
test_eye.py --- The "main" driver of our program. Locates the iris center (center of the pupil)

./src/python/track_ic
corner_detection --- Used to track the eye corners ***Incomplete
ellipse_fitting --- Used to track iris center and fit ellipse
ransac.py --- Used to further refine ellipse around iris ***Incomplete 
***More to come


Goal of project:
We are designing a gaze tracking system which will allow my nephew Caleb, who is special needs,
the ability to control a computer. Other eye tracking technologies exist which allow Caleb to control 
a computer, but they are difficult to setup and uncomfortable. Our eye tracking system will use a 
camera to track eye movement. The setup of the eye tracking system will be as simple as pressing a button.
The end goal of the system will be to create a simple means by which my nephew can enjoy the use of a computer.

Functional Description (What does it do?):
Using an IR sensitive Camera, Python, and OpenCV, we are tracking the head, eye region, iris center, eye corners,
and more in order to calculate a gaze vector. This gaze vector will then be mapped to a desktop coordinate,
which will enable the mouse to move to the users gaze vector.
